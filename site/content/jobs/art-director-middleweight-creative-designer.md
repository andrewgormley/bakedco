**About Us**

We are Baked, a creative agency. We bring consumer brands to life through creative strategy, advertising, design, brand development & content creation.\
\
Headquartered at The Bakery, overlooking Torquay Harbour, our clients include Under Armour, The North Face, Red Bull and ASICS. Our mission is to produce the highest standard of work for brands that believe in the power of creativity.\
\
We have five core values - positive attributes we all bring to life every day, on every task and in every interaction.\
\
**We believe in the value of creativity**\
To us, creativity is everything. We use it to solve problems for our clients and to express ourselves, both as a brand and as individuals. Our passion to produce the best creative in the world is at the very core of our brand.\
\
**We are collaborative by nature**\
Collaboration builds our influence as a brand and means we all pull in the same direction to produce our best work. We all put sharing and teamwork ahead of our own egos.\
\
**We live every day with kindness & empathy**\
We want everyone to look forward to coming to work. We live in a ‘TGIM’ mentality. You being happy at work is the only way we will achieve our vision and mission as a brand.\
\
**We relish experimentation**\
Our best work can only be achieved by trying new things, and not being afraid to fail. Our brand doesn’t just think outside the box, we live outside it.\
\
**We stand out amongst the crowd**\
We aren’t just another creative shop. We stand as a brand amongst a sea of ‘me too’ agencies. We don’t do vanilla and we believe the worst phrase in the world is ‘it’s always been done that way.’
