Part of the Fresh Foam X collection, this running shoe features an updated Fresh Foam midsole that delivers enhanced softness and a more energetic rebound than its predecessor.  New Balance wanted to communicate the benefits of the shoe through one of their key retail partners.

Comfort, cushioning and lightweight flexibility were all at the forefront of our visual communication around the Fresh Foam X franchise. We modelled the shoe in 3D before placing it alongside elements which represented the key features of the product, including cushioned balls in the X shape.
