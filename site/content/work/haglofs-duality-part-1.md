Haglöfs wanted to explain the unique functionality of their Duality shoe to their retail partners. We partnered with the brand to create a video to sit alongside multiple print, retail & digital assets, all produced from a 3D scan of the shoes.

We created high quality 3D scans of the shoes and midsoles. We referenced  aspects of nature to highlight the difference between the midsoles. A focus on modular design allowed us to create multiple assets for print, retail and digital use. These assets highlighted the two different ways to wear the shoe, tying in to the 'Walk Both Ways' tagline.
