With the creative strategy for the campaign already defined by the FIVE team, our live action team produced a campaign that answered the brief to capture a gritty, urban London football vibe.

As the client wanted a street football vibe, we made the production feel like the audience was a part of the action. To achieve this, we used a handheld setup which enabled us to capture the correct look and feel whilst working around shooting in multiple locations in one day.
