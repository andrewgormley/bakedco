    copy: Bikes are in Kye Forte’s blood. His dad Rick raced motocross and built Kye his first BMX as a kid. Fueled by his father’s passion, Kye went on to become a pro BMX and mountain bike rider, before recently revving up the engine and switching to flat track.
  - subtitle:
    copy: The Twelfthman series was already well established with three other films having already been produced. This meant we needed to adapt our approach to fit with their brand message and make sure this film sat well within the existing series. We worked collaboratively with Twelfthman in the development stage sourcing talent and seeking out relevant stories.
