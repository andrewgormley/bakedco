  - subtitle: Project Summary
    copy: For the past 20 years, Haglöfs’ L.I.M Series has been the vanguard of
      innovative light weight trekking gear. As low weight as possible, without
      ever compromising with performance or durability. Even though the basic
      concept seems simple enough, the journey is endless. There is always a
      smarter design, a better fabric or an improved function to be tried out.
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: We used a mixed media approach to show the evolution of L.I.M and the
      Outsiders who made it possible. Using found footage, handmade materials
      and user-generated content, we created a textured narrative to inspire
      people to join the community. L.I.M goes beyond a product. It is a state
      of mind. L.I.M is about a community. A community that keeps innovating to
      reach new heights.
