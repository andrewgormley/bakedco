  - subtitle: Project Summary
    copy: Under Armour challenged us to produce assets to introduce the HOVR™ Mega 2
      CLONE, to be used in their FW21 Connected Running paid media campaign. The
      tone? Urban, gritty & authentic.
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: >-
      We combined product beauty shots, snappy editing and a powerful voiceover
      to promote the product launch. We showcased MapMyRun & Connected Running
      technology in a concise 15-second video summary for each gender. Alongside
      these, we created a longer 30-second piece, which will feature both
      genders, focused on the CLONE technology.


      We translated technical information so it was easy to understand and highlighted the benefits to the consumer - a customised fit and optimised comfort. We drew attention to each of these areas through the use of Phantom Ultrahigh-Speed slow-motion shots of the shoe in action, mixed alongside running content and 3D shoe renders with graphical elements
