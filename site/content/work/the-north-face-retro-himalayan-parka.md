From protecting alpinists and adventurers to warming the backs of urban explorers and city commuters, the Retro Himalayan Jacket truly is a jacket full of stories. Already an established mountaineer's essential, The North Face challenged us to create a piece of content which introduced the jacket as a streetwear staple for this season and beyond.

Using a mixture of live-action production, 3D animation and visual effects, we combined the modern technology of FUTURELIGHT™ and 700 Fill Down with heritage expedition content and an urban studio environment. Using advanced visual effect techniques such as data-moshing, we were able to seamlessly tell the story of The North Face's signature jacket from its routes in mountaineering heritage through to the present day.
