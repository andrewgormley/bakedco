  - subtitle: Project Summary
    copy: From protecting alpinists and adventurers to warming the backs of urban
      explorers and city commuters, the Retro Himalayan Jacket truly is a jacket
      full of stories. Already an established mountaineer's essential, The North
      Face challenged us to create a piece of content which introduced the
      jacket as a streetwear staple for this season and beyond.
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: Using a mixture of live-action production, 3D animation and visual
      effects, we combined the modern technology of FUTURELIGHTâ„¢ and 700 Fill
      Down with heritage expedition content and an urban studio environment.
      Using advanced visual effect techniques such as data-moshing, we were able
      to seamlessly tell the story of The North Face's signature jacket from its
      routes in mountaineering heritage through to the present day.
