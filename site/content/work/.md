      The first in our Baked Stories series featuring long time friend and chef
      Luca Beradino. In this short story we talk with Luca about what drives him
      and what cooking means to him. 


      With Italian and French lineage, food is well and truly embedded into Luca's DNA. It's those food memories throughout life that he's pulled inspiration from that have inspired 'Andria', his new restaurant based in Dartmouth Devon.
