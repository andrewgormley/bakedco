Haglöfs wanted to explain the unique functionality of their Duality shoe to both retail partners and consumers. We partnered with the brand to create two videos and multiple print, retail & digital assets from a 3D scan of the shoes.

We created high quality 3D scans of the shoes and midsoles. We referenced  aspects of nature to highlight the difference between the midsoles - using moss for the softer midsole and rocks for the harder midsole. A focus on modular design allowed us to create multiple assets for print, retail and digital use. These assets highlighted the two different ways to wear the shoe, tying in to the 'Walk Both Ways' tagline.
