    copy: >-
      For our first project working with ASICS, the brand challenged us to
      create a simple, clear and consistent creative formula to showcase their
      technologies in a way that would engage their running audience around
      their key brand narrative: the benefits of running go beyond the body.


      Our challenge was demonstrating that a sound body leads to a sound mind.


      Each innovation and shoe were unique and have proven superiority vs. their competitors. They tapped into specific needs and insights from their audience and have been acclaimed by influencers and media.


      Ultimately, we wanted to iconise the unique ASICS technologies in a way that celebrated both the key functional benefits of the product, “Sound Body”, and the mental benefit for the runner, “Sound Mind”­­.

    copy: >-
      Three shoes, three films. The structure for each film reflected a new,
      minimal direction of the brand. Each film contained beauty shots of 3D
      scanned products in a minimal environment. These product shots focused on
      the technology of the shoes and displayed the technology in action.
      Alongside this, we included supporting 3D animations as a visual metaphor
      for "sound mind".


      Our art direction was minimal, premium, and fresh. These qualities highlighted 'Sound Mind and Sound Body’ and represented the same level of craft and thoughtfulness as go into the products themselves.


      We built all three films to exist in the same world, with each space will having subtle changes that help tie into some of the key benefits of that shoe. No props or objects had greater detail than the product itself.


      So, on to the technology itself and our visual metaphors. 


      First up, ASICSGRIP™ - a grippy shoe for trail running. 


      We used a visual metaphor of the plant Drosera Filiformis, commonly known as the thread-leaved sundew. It’s a small, insectivorous, rosette-forming species of perennial herb. A species of sundew, it is unusual within its genus in that the long, erect, filiform (thread-like) leaves of this plant unroll in spirals. 


      Secondly, ASICS GUIDESOLE™ - a shoe packed full of energy.


      We used a visual metaphor of ribbons of foam filling the screen. They rush from the shoe, sending a wave of energy through the ribbons. The energy causes a chaotic motion of continuous waves, and the energy continued to pass through the waves as they all find a synchronised rhythm.


      Finally, ASICS 3D SPACE CONSTRUCTION™ - softness and comfort. 


      We opened on the shoe in mid-air surrounded by hexagon-shaped foam cushions and stone balls. Stone balls collide with the base of the shoe. We see the bottom of the shoe cushion the impact, then the hex cushions surrounding the shoe protecting it from the stone spheres.


      Hexagon patterns form from the surface, ripple out from a single piece of foam. We then see the grid of hexagon foam and push the foam to show how soft it is. Finally, we cut to a top-down angle of the shoe falling towards a foam pit made from hexagon cushions.

      The creative concept for the project brought the single most important
      piece of technology in the shoe with the benefit to the mind each consumer
      can experience from it. 


      The creative outcomes were driven by using 3D animation and visual effects, enhancing the qualities of the technology inside the shoes. The materials used reflected the technical benefits of the shoe and focus the viewer on these. Light, brightly coloured gradients contrasted with soft foams and stone textures. 


      Showing the detail of the product and close-ups of the technology in dynamic positions, we used light to create contrasting areas of focus and highlight the technology of the shoe. Environmental lighting helped show the wider minimalist world through tranquil, soft shadows and moving light.
