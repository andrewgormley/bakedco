Haglöfs challenged us to highlight a new chapter in their synthetic insulation story, demonstrating the brand as a leader within the outdoor performance category. We combined performance and innovation to show the use of groundbreaking technology never seen before within outdoor performance.

We created a pioneering conversation piece to highlight the never-before-seen performance of the Mimic Graphene product. We built the entire project in 3D, utilising a scan of the hero jacket. We used different animation elements to highlight the breathable, warm and light nature of the products ready for the Nordic mountains, using the glowing ball of Mimic Graphene to create a feed-stopping, engaging content piece.
