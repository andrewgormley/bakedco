Back Yourself centres around people's goals, struggles & achievements in their fitness journey, whether that's at home or outdoors. We spoke to the young demographic who work on their fitness goals all year round, but with extra energy in January. We showcased their fitness journey through short, engaging videos with supporting still imagery.

We inspired the audience to work to improve and achieve their goals through simple, raw ‘one shot’ style videos that kept the viewer focussed on the product, the activity and the athlete. We supported these videos with an even more product-focussed execution. Capturing looping video of the product from each workout situation, we shot close-up static cutaway shots of product that we looped with campaign messaging, highlighting the product fit, style and detail.
