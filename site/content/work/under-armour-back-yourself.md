  - subtitle: Project Summary
    copy: Back Yourself centres around people's goals, struggles & achievements in
      their fitness journey, whether that's at home or outdoors. We spoke to the
      young demographic who work on their fitness goals all year round, but with
      extra energy in January. We showcased their fitness journey through short,
      engaging videos with supporting still imagery.
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: The audience was inspired to work to improve and achieve their goals
      through simple, raw ‘one shot’ style videos that kept the viewer focussed
      on the product, the activity and the athlete. Baked supported these videos
      with an even more product-focused execution. Capturing looping video of
      the product from each workout situation, they shot close-up static cutaway
      shots of the product that were looped with campaign messaging,
      highlighting the product fit, style and detail.
