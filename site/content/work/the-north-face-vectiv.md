    copy: >-
      The North Face partnered with us to produce creative assets that
      introduced their 'venturer' consumer to the benefits of the new VECTIV™
      Futurelight trail running shoes. This content had the the ultimate goal of
      educating consumers on the new technology, as well as leading them to
      conversion.


      We were talking to the everyday trail runner - someone who runs often, enjoys adventure and is looking for comfort and protection over lightweight speed and performance.
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: >-
      After over a year of confinement, consumers were seeking the freedom of
      adventure more than ever before. The invigorating thrill of exploring
      nature. The rush of adrenaline we get from moving our bodies unbounded by
      four walls.


      The content showcased the running and hiking adventures of two protagonists in different locations, positioning the VECTIV™ x Futurelight shoe as the common thread that ties them together - allowing them to adventure further than ever before. The two narratives highlighted the versatility of the product, enhanced with the inclusion of 3D environments, which focused on the waterproof Futurelight upper.


      This is more than just a run. It’s not about the calories burned or the PB. It’s about the adventure; the money can’t buy experience that we need to find balance in our hectic lives, to escape and feel alive. Each timeline highlights the key technology and how the VECTIV™ shoes helps power you further; further along the coast, higher up the mountain, deeper into the forest.
