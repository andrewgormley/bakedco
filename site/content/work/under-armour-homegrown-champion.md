Keeping it simple. Losing the fluff. Keeping the product front and centre. This campaign aimed to make Trent look statuesque to showcase Under Armour in a way that would make JD Sports consumers believe in the brand. We defined an iconic silhouette for Trent Alexander-Arnold and combined this with a powerful campaign message, 'Homegrown Champion'.

Capturing content with Trent in various environments, we highlighted his character traits through single images. In-store, we used a variety of different pieces of powerful imagery in point of sale.

A campaign extension for social media, featuring 'The Kid', focuses on Trent’s journey as a homegrown talent - from growing up playing football on the streets to where he is now. Each scene is used to show the viewer a different attribute which the fan believes is crucial to the makeup of a Champion.
