  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: Keeping it simple. Losing the fluff. Keeping the product front and centre.
      This campaign aimed to make Trent look statuesque to showcase Under Armour
      in a way that would make JD Sports consumers believe in the brand. We
      defined an iconic silhouette for Trent Alexander-Arnold and combined this
      with a powerful campaign message, 'Homegrown Champion'. Capturing content
      with Trent in various environments, we highlighted his character traits
      through single images. In-store, we used a variety of different pieces of
      powerful imagery in point of sale.
  - subtitle: Social Media
    copy: A campaign extension for social media, featuring 'The Kid', focuses on
      Trentâ€™s journey as a homegrown talent - from growing up playing football
      on the streets to where he is now. Each scene is used to show the viewer a
      different attribute which the fan believes is crucial to the makeup of a
      Champion.
