  - subtitle: Project Summary
    copy: "For our first project working with GO Sport in the Middle East, we were
      challenged to elevate the brand’s content to a new level across their
      running category, whilst respecting the recently refreshed brand
      direction. The brief covered the Middle East, primarily Qatar, Saudi
      Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.


      GO Sport brings the best multi-brand sporting goods experience to
      the marketplace from all the major and local sports brands. They have a
      strong mission to support and encourage sports participation, allowing
      everyone regardless of age and ability to adopt an active lifestyle by
      offering the right product to suit individual needs. \r\n"
  - subtitle: Our Approach
    copy: "Go Further. It means pushing yourself. Through the pain, through the
      barriers. Breaking down the boundaries that exist in your mind.\r In gear
      that holds up. That works as hard as you do. Gear that's got you
      covered.\r This is a campaign talking to the grinders. Those who are
      inspired to better themselves. Those who are pushing themselves outside of
      their comfort zone.\r\n"
  - subtitle: Creative Concept
    copy: "Running is a varied and often miscommunicated sport. We took the approach
      of translating GO Sport's values to an audience that run AS a sport, as
      well as run FOR sport.


      By creating an anthem film that drives the core messages of
      inclusivity, community and self-motivation, we inspired and educated the
      audience on the freedom running can provide and how GO Sport facilitate
      this with the best equipment.


      The consumer is driven and dedicated, so our anthem film shows
      on-screen talent pushing themselves to their limits. Though this doesn’t
      mean winning. We know failure is a part of success, so we championed those
      moments as well. We show all the hard work and dedication that it takes to
      get to where you want to go - it's that ‘Go Further’ mentality.\ 


      Weaving between 3 scenes captured in different locations: desert
      roads, desert trail and downtown, the contrast gave the content variety
      and added a sense of journey.


      We captured an eye-catching and visually stimulating b-roll that is
      sliced between hero imagery. This added another layer to the content and
      helped evoke a feeling of hard work and grit that naturally fed into the
      campaign's overall narrative. These moments are paramount in showing how
      committed these individuals are to being the best version of themselves.
      These are the nuts and bolts. The blood, sweat and tears.


      Focussing on real athletes, this is a genuine story of handwork and
      determination. Our cast resonated with the consumer and inspired them to
      push themselves further. Big action sequences coupled with a
      thought-provoking voiceover delivered an authentic and inspirational
      message, motivating the consumer.\r"
